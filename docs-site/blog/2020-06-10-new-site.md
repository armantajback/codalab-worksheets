We're pleased to announce a new documentation site, built with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). We'll also be sending out an occasional email digest with the updates that are posted to the blog here. If you're interested in being added to the list, please email <a href="mailto:codalab.worksheets@gmail.com">codalab.worksheets@gmail.com</a>.

Here are some of the major new features that we have released within the past few months:

## Frontend improvements

- We've introduced a new frontend that allows you to edit cells directly from the UI without having to go and edit source.

- The worksheet header is now sticky, so the main buttons to add text / upload / run are easily accessible from the top.

- Worksheet loading is now faster, after the addition of async loading of file contents ([#2246](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2246)) and search result blocks ([#2086](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2086)).

- Added a search bar for worksheets, allowing you to more easily access the worksheets you need ([#2181](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2181)).

- The addition of a cut / copy / paste feature has made it easier to manage worksheets exclusively by interacting through the frontend GUI ([#2009](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2009), [#2143](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2143)).

- Users can now upload directories and multiple files from the browser ([#2043](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2043)).

## Tooling

- We've set up frontend automation testing using Selenium, allowing us to catch regressions earlier ([#2028](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2028)).

- We regularly run stress tests on the CodaLab backend before releases to make sure that it can handle large files and large loads ([#1810](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/1810)).


## Future

We're focusing on ways to improve the usability of CodaLab Worksheets. Here are some other projects we are working on:

- Externalizing storage. This involves:
  - Removing limitations on mounting dependencies ([#1115](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/issues/1115))
  - Adding the `--link` CLI argument so that users can use files with CodaLab without uploading it to the system
  - Allowing using storage backends such as S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS, or HTTP URLs to import bundles
- Creating an `--interactive` mode so that users can use CodaLab more easily
- Switching our CI tool from Travis to GitHub Actions to speed up the contribution / release process

We couldn't have done this without all the feedback from users and help from contributors! [Open an issue](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/issues/new/choose) if there is something else you would like to see in CodaLab Worksheets.
