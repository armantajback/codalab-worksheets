We're pleased to announce a new documentation site, built with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). We'll also be sending out an occasional email digest with the updates that are posted to the blog here. If you're interested in being added to the list, please email <a href="mailto:codalab.worksheets@gmail.com">codalab.worksheets@gmail.com</a>.

Here are some of the major new features that we have released within the past few months:

## Frontend improvements

- We've introduced a new frontend that allows you to edit cells directly from the UI without having to go and edit source.
- Worksheet loading is now faster, after the addition of async loading of file contents ([#2246](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2246)) and search result blocks ([#2086](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2086)).
- Added a search bar for worksheets, allowing you to more easily access the worksheets you need ([#2181](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2181)).
- The addition of a cut / copy / paste feature has made it easier to manage worksheets exclusively by interacting through the frontend GUI ([#2009](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2009), [#2143](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2143)).

## Tooling

- We've set up frontend automation testing using Selenium, allowing us to catch regressions earlier ([#2028](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2028)).
