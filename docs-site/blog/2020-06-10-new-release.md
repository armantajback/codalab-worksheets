We're pleased to announce a new documentation site, built with Docusaurus. We're also sending out a regular email digest. We've just released

Here are some of the major new features that we have released within the past few months:

## Frontend improvements

- We've introduced a new frontend with drag and drop options. We also have a new UI for bundle detail layout ([#1543](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/1543))
- Worksheet loading is now faster -- we have async loading of file contents ([#2246](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2246)) and search queries ([#2086](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2086)) in queries
- Add a search bar for worksheets ([#2181](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2181)).
